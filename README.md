## Animatable Musician with InstantAvatar
## Speaker Verfication Light Weight Model
Experiments on pruning spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb speaker verification model and compared the error rate with original model trained on the same dataset.
Reached similar error rate and was able to inference at a faster speed.
