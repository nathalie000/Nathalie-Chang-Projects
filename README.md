## Animatable Musician with InstantAvatar
Our goal is to utitlize Neural Radiance Field(NeRF) to construct animatable musician 3D models with apperances reconstructed from real life 2d images. Input a piece of
music, then our system will synthesize a novel view video of the person playing the piece of music using certain instrument. Our final output is a video of the 3D human model interacting with certain object, which is a new application of a NeRF model.

## Speaker Verfication Light Weight Model
Experiments on pruning spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb speaker verification model and compared the error rate with original model trained on the same dataset.
Reached similar error rate and was able to inference at a faster speed.
## Image classifaction Light Weight Model
We trained a light wieght image classifacation model (ShuffleNetV2-x0.5) using data distillation and pruning. The model was trained and tested on the datset Modified BIRDS 525 SPECIES. We reached 0.969 F1-score, which was only 0.024 points less than a model (RegNetX-1.6GF
) that has 109 times larger number of parameters than our model. Training detail and result analysis are in the report.

## ACM Multimedia 2021 Grand Challenge - Meet Deadline Requirements (Python)
A bandwidth esitmator impleneted using reinforce learning to adjust sending rate,  
and tested several distinct score functions to find the best fit.  
Details are written in report.
## Android Todolist Application (Kotlin)
This application combines todolist with pet raising game,  
developed using kotlin under the Android Studio enviorment.
## Photo Source Classification (Python)
A classifier that classifies whether a photo was taken by an Apple phone or Samsung phone.  
Our model structure and tuning details are showen in report.
